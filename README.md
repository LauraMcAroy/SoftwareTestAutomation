How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Aside from frequent running and debugging of code, JUnit tests can be used to test all requirements of a program and ensure that all aspects of the system are performing correctly. Extensive testing needs to be done on each program, including static and dynamic testing techniques, unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Using the requirements and specification documents are crucial in interpretting the consumer's needs. The software's design should follow these documents closely in order to ensure that you are designing a program that the consumer can use.

How do I approach designing software?
I use a systematic approach to design my software. Using the specifications documents I prioritize and organize the requirements the program needs to contain. I then begin to design the software, reusing code as much as possible to ensure the code is efficient. After the code is written I can write JUnit tests to verify that the software is doing everything that it is supposed to do, and correct portions of the code that contain errors.
